Methods:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identified trends such as higher attrition among younger, lower-paid employees working overtime.
Logistic Regression: Highlighted key predictors (e.g., MonthlyIncome, OverTime) and their influence on attrition risk.
Decision Trees: Offered interpretable insights with key decision paths around OverTime, Age, and Job Satisfaction.
Clustering: Grouped employees into meaningful segments to guide personalized retention strategies.



Key Findings:

OverTime, low MonthlyIncome, and younger age were strongly linked to higher attrition.
Cluster analysis revealed three workforce segments with unique retention needs.



Model Performance:

Logistic Regression: ~67% accuracy, 66% recall.
Decision Tree: ~70% accuracy, 69% recall.


Business Recommendations:

Improve compensation for younger, high-turnover roles.
Reduce overtime to address burnout.
Personalize engagement efforts based on employee profiles.
